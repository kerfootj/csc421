    "Text categorization is the task of assigning a given document to one of a fixed set of categories, on the basis of text it contains. Naive Bayes models are often used for this task. In these models, the query variable is\n",
    "the document category, and the effect variables are the presence/absence\n",
    "of each word in the language; the assumption is that words occur independently in documents within a given category (condititional independence), with frequencies determined by document category. Download the following file: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/pabo/movie-review-data/review_polarity.tar.gz containing a dataset that has been used for text mining consisting of movie reviews classified into negative and positive. You\n",
    "will see that there are two folders for the positivie and negative category and they each contain multiple text files with the reviews. You can find more information about the dataset at: \n",

    "Our goal will be to build a simple Naive Bayes classifier for this dataset. More complicated approaches using term frequency and inverse document frequency weighting and many more words are possible but the basic concepts\n",
    "are the same. The goal is to understand the whole process so DO NOT use existing machine learning packages but rather build the classifier from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our feature vector representation for each text file will be simply a binary vector that shows which of the following words are present in the text file: Awful Bad Boring Dull Effective Enjoyable Great Hilarious. For example the text file cv996 11592.txt would be represented as (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0) because it contains Effective and Great but none of the other words."
