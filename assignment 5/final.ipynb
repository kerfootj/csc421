If it rained the agent can determine if the garden needs to be watered, partially watered, or not watered at all becuase it knows if the garden got enough water that day. The environment is deterministic, if the agent turns on the sprinklers the garden gets watered. The task environment is episodic becuase the agent's actions aren't affected by the previous actions. The environment is static for the reflex agent because the environment doesn't change while the agent is thinking.

    "\n",
    "Consider a similar combination lock setup as question 1 but with the following difference: the user needs to enter a specific sequence of 3-digit unlocking configurations before entering the final configuration. A button is used to indicate that an  intermediate configuration has been reached. For example the user rotates the gears to reach the first 3-letter combination, then presses the button, then rotate the gears to enter the second 3-letter combination, etc until the final. A solution consists of a sequence of 3-letter combinations where the first item is the initial configuration (S0), then there are some intermediate configurations (S1, S2, ..., SN−1), and the final configuration (SN ) is the last item. Fortunately for each  intermediate step there is a set of 4 candidate configurations that can be tried (provided by a spy). This candidate set is different for each step of ther process. You can think of the initial configuration as the initial state, and the final  configuration as the goal state, and the intermediate configurations as the search states. In analogy to the Romania city  problem, the initial configuration corresponds to the start city, the candidate intermediate configurations are the neighbors of a particular step, and the final configuration corresponds to the destination city.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of a solution is the total number of gear moves required to unlock (going through the all intermediate configurations). Note that the gears can move in both directions. For example the cost of going from A, B, D to B, D, C is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 using the following gear moves: (A, B, D) → (B, B, D), B, B, D → (B, D, D), B, D, D → (B, D, C). Note that the cost of going directly from the inital state to the final configuration is NOT the same as the cost of going through the intermediate configurations.\n",

    "<div style=\"padding-left: 25px\">\n",
    "    An admissable heuristic would be the number of gear moves needed to unlock the lock from the current configuration without considering further intermediate configurations. For example if the curent cofiguration is AAA and the goal configuration is BCD the huristic would be 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. It is admissable because it will never over estimate the true cost of opening the lock since possible intermediate steps aren't considered. The intermediate sets will add gear rotations and therefore increase the true cost of opening the lock. In an extreme case the heurisitc could be the same as the true cost if all the intermediate steps are the same as the final solution. This is still not an overestimate and therefore an admissable heuristic.\n",
